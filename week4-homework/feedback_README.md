Really great work so far! Just one minor issue that should be pretty easy to fix:

1. For the linear regression with plink, there are a couple of small issues: first, the `--assoc` flag isn't quite what we want. I believe this does something called a Wald test, when we want to just do simple linear regression. Check out the hint we added to the assignment for how to do this. You'll also want to include the top 10 PCs as covariates (also in our hint) (0.5 point)

Everything looks awesome, and it looks like you're well on your way to getting your boxplot working! We still just need the boxplot itself and the answer to quesiton 7 (-1.5)

Really enjoying your encouraging messages to yourself in the comments! Very glad you feel like you're understanding things!!
