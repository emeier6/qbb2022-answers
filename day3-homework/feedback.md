Overall this looks great. You plotting code looks good and your plots look correct. It's worth toying with formatting when plotting when you have issues like a legend covering data. I really enjoyed the comments in the script. It was like having a narrator with your code. My favorite was "SHE BEAUTFUL". All in all, well done. Keep it up!
