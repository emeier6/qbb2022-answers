Great work! Your solutions all look complete, and your documentation always says what each part of your solution is doing. You could organize/document your answers a bit more, but that's not at all necessary for completion of the assignment (especially once you're in "just finish it, don't make it look nice" mode), it just makes it a bit easier to read.

I think it's cool that you included the history of fixes that you tried - this is something I would also put in my lab notebook if I were debugging a script, so that future Steph could look back and see what worked and didn't work for a certain issue. To make it easier to read (and to reduce the amount of typing for myself, lol), I would usually just say something like:
```
* Tried adding `NR==$i`, didn't fix the error
* Tried giving awk the `nuc` variable before the script body with `-v nuc=$nuc`, and then removing the $ before `nuc`. This fixed it
```

Anyway, good job and keep up the good work!
