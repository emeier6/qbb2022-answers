Great work! This is alllllmost done. We just need a couple more things:
1. I see you code for the `rank_genes_groups` plots, but not the plots themselves. I see a comment that says the code didn't work, but I'm not sure what happened because the code looks fine... remember we want a plot for both the t-test method of finding marker genes, and the logreg method (-0.5)
2. Your support plots for part 4 all look great, we just need the last bit that actually makes the UMAP or tSNE plots with the cell type labels added for the appropriate clusters. Try to (for six different clusters) assign one cell type, change the names of those clusters in `adata` to those cell-types, and then plot the tSNE or UMAP with the updated cluster names (-1.5)

Really great otherwise though!
