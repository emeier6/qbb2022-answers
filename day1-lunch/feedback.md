This looks great! You've recorded your thought process and all the commands you used clearly and comprehensively. Keep up the good work.

I like your in depth answer for 3C - you've outlined the exact steps you would need to follow to do that analysis, which is always most of the work :)

I think for 4C, you've ended up finding the number of total individuals within each superpopulation, rather than the number of subpopulations. If you only keep the "population" column, you no longer have the subpopulation column to separate out subpops. But your result is still interesting - why do you think the creators of this dataset chose to include so many individuals with African ancestry?
