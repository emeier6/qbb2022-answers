# day 4 homework feedback

nice plots! I really like how the heatmap squares are labeled with the actual power values

Good comments in the README and good code! The assignment does ask you to incorporate the nested for loop and storing the power within the `run_experiment()` function rather than calling that function repeatedly. What you've done works and leads to the same conclusions, but consider how you might edit the function to incorporate the new code. While your results will be the same every time your script is run, will your results be the same compared to someone who only calls the `run_experiment()` function once therefore only sets the random seed once?
