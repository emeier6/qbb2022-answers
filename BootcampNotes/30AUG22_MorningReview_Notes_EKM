### TALKING ABOUT AWK FUNCTION #########


#awk and grep look row by row through data
#awk is good at specifying the pattern magic, very quick


	IE: f1.vcf
	chr		pos		ref		alt
	21		1		A		G
	21		2		C		G
	21		3		G		A
	21		4		T		C
	
	awk '--- ---' f1.vcf #Looking through reference and alt
	
	'{ (#what we want to search for#)}
	'{ ($3 #for 3rd column# == #is something equal to# "G #letter of interest#" ) (print)}'
	#If I am looking at G, print the entire row if conditional true #first 
	#If wanting to only print a certain column (IE column 2):
	'{ ($3 #for 3rd column# == "G #letter of interest#" ) (print $2)}'
	
	
	awk '{print}'
	#Simply prints the entire workbook
	
	
	awk '{print $3-$2}' #will subtract 3rd minus second column in awk (useful for bed files that say something like:
		IE:
		21 	5001		50003)
		
		
	awk '/^# {next}	{print}' 
	#If the row starts with a # or note, then skip. If it does not, then you can print
	
	
	###  Getting fancy with the printing in awk: #########
	print Æ’		
	#yeilds this notation:
	"%-10s" $1
	number is	"%-10d" $1
	can change the number in front of d to change the number at the end of the output
	
	#Easier way (not all in awk):
	
	awk '{expression}' | {-v ::-2}
	
	
	
	
	
########## BEDTOOLS REVIEW ###########
	
	#What does bedtools INTERSECT do?:
		#Bedtools intersect looks at two files (file A and file B), and cuts out the parts of A that is also in B. If the A file is vcf, then outputs in a vcf. If A file is bed, outputs in bed. What is returned are the parts in file A found in file B.
	
	
	#What does bedtools CLOSESTS do?:
		#
		File A: 	ch5		50		75
		
		File B:		ch5		20		23
					ch5		80		82
					
		#For every feeature in File A, what is the closest feature in file B?
		
		#OUTPUT:
		chr5		50		75		chr		80		82
